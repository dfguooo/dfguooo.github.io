I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [NTU IoT Research Group](https://ntuiot.xyz/), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, where I also obtained my Ph.D degree, advised by [Prof. Rui Tan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/). Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree from NTU, and my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).  

My work focuses on the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, with an emphasis on autonomous driving perception and location sensing. I am interested in how sensing systems behave under real-world constraints and how to make them more reliable and secure. I enjoy hands-on experiments and building practical systems from the ground up.

<!-- My research focuses on building reliable and secure sensing systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). I study how sensing modalities such as light, radio, and acoustic signals behave throughout the physical sensing process and under real-world constraints, and I develop robust sensing systems that withstand challenges including malicious attacks, environmental factors, and hardware limitations. My current work centers on robust perception for autonomous driving, and I have also explored location sensing in challenging IoT environments. I am an experimentalist and system builder who emphasizes real-world, experiment-driven research to build systems that operate reliably under practical constraints. -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
