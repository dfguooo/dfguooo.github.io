I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [NTU IoT Research Group](https://ntuiot.xyz/), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, where I also obtained my Ph.D degree under the supervision of [Prof. Rui Tan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/). Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree from NTU, and my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). 

My research aims to improve the reliability of sensing systems in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), with a current focus on advancing robust vehicular perception.

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Rui Tan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/) and to work closely with [NTU IoT Research Group](https://ntuiot.xyz/). I received my M.Sc. degree from NTU, and my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).  -->

<!-- My research focuses on sensing across various modalities (imagery, radio, acoustic, etc.) for cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), with particular interest in robust perception for autonomous driving and location sensing in IoT. As a system builder, I enjoy getting hands-on to build real-world systems and am passionate about experiment-driven research that tackles practical challenges. -->
