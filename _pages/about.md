I am a Ph.D. student and Research Associate at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Rui Tan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/) and work closely with [NTU IoT Research Group](https://ntuiot.xyz/).
Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. degree from Nanyang Technological University, and my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. 

My research interests broadly lie in the field of sensing in Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems. I am passionate about experiment-oriented research, and enjoy getting my hands dirty to build up real-world systems.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
