I am a Ph.D. student at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Rui Tan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/) and to work closely with [NTU IoT Research Group](https://ntuiot.xyz/). I received my M.Sc. degree from NTU, and my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). 


My research focuses on sensing across various modalities (imagery, radio, acoustic, etc.) for cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), with particular interest in robust perception for autonomous driving and location sensing in IoT. As a system builder, I enjoy getting hands-on to build real-world systems and am passionate about experiment-driven research that tackles practical challenges.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
