In my free time, I enjoy <s>sleeping</s> sports and music.

I am a badminton enthusiast. I play and train badminton on a regular basis. I am also a football fan and a life-long supporter of FC Barcelona.

I learned saxophone for years in my childhood before I switched to bass guitar and played in a band during my undergrad years. Now I enjoy strumming some random basslines in my bedroom to add some funky vibes to my life.
